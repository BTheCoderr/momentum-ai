# üöÄ Momentum AI: Production Roadmap to Unicorn Status

## üìä Current State Assessment (Y Combinator Review)

### ‚úÖ **What's Working (Strong Foundation)**

**1. Core AI Engine**
- ‚úÖ SmartCheckIn: 4-step behavioral data collection (mood, energy, progress, reflection)
- ‚úÖ Groq AI Integration: Real-time insight generation with intelligent fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Pattern Recognition: Time-of-day, mood, energy, and consistency analysis
- ‚úÖ Behavioral Database: Comprehensive user_events and insights tables with proper indexing

**2. User Experience**
- ‚úÖ Beautiful gradient UI with mobile-first design
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure in check-in flow reduces friction
- ‚úÖ Real-time streak visualization with gamification
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive dashboard with actionable insights

**3. Technical Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Supabase integration with Row Level Security
- ‚úÖ TypeScript throughout for type safety
- ‚úÖ NextAuth integration (though currently disabled)
- ‚úÖ PWA capabilities with offline support

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gaps (Pre-Launch Blockers)**

**1. No Real Behavioral Loop**
```typescript
// Current: Single check-in insights
// Needed: Multi-week pattern recognition
const behavioralModel = {
  weeklyPatterns: analyzeWeeklyTrends(userEvents),
  riskPrediction: predictGoalAbandonment(patterns),
  interventionTiming: calculateOptimalNudges(userBehavior)
};
```

**2. Missing Retention Mechanics**
- No social proof or accountability partners
- No progressive feature unlocking
- No email/push notification system

**3. Monetization Not Implemented**
- Stripe exists but no paywall triggers
- No clear premium feature differentiation
